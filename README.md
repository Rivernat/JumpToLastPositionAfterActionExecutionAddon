# JumpToLastPositionAfterActionExecutionAddon

## Description

This add-on adds in the **Tools** menu of Citavi's PDF Viewer the command **Jump to previous position...** with the key combination <kbd>ALT</kbd>+<kbd>F3</kbd>. The command is active if a jump has been made in the document by clicking on an internal link stored in the document. The last position before a jump is executed is always saved and this as long as the document is open.
